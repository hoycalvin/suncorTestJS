# suncorTestJS
Technical test for Suncor, (DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS), There are still many assertions that need to be added.

Now in JavaScript! While not all assertions are included, this is the general assertion flow that will be included.
Similarily, while there is no function for Question 2 (Suncor), the build would basically be the same as standardUserTest(), with differences being navigation to the Suncor site, and assertions from the bottom of this README.

Tests are based on these issues:
- standard_user = No errors, and the flow goes well until checkout is finished.
- locked_out_user = The user can't enter the site
- problem_user = The user has some problems logging in
- performance_glitch_user = The user experiences performance issues that make the page slow.

Question 1:
standard_user  -  Navigate to page.

Assert user info text box "username" and "password" are visible.

Assert "login button" is visible.
                  
Enter user info and click "Login".

Assert that the shopping cart, left hamburger menu, and product grid are all present on the page.

Assert math is correct, i.e 9.99 + 29.99 = 39.98. Assert that value is equal to "Price Total" value.

performance_glitch_user - Since Selenium is not ideal for performance testing, the best we can do is assert the site didn't timeout. That can be done by checking if any element is visible after some time (here, 3 seconds).
                  
Navigate to page.

Assert user info text box "username" and "password" are visible.

Assert "login button" is visible.
